A Node.js + Express + EJS web application for user registration, login, and API key management. Users can securely create and manage their own API keys, while admins have access to a dashboard to view, monitor, and deactivate keys when necessary. The entire application can be run locally or inside a Docker container for easy deployment.

I built this project as a learning exercise to explore how APIs work and to gain hands-on experience with the Docker environment — focusing on understanding containerized app deployment and backend API integration.
